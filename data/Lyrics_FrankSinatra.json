  "plain": "Thought by many to be one of the best singers of all time, Frank Sinatra is truly a music legend. Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1915, and his music is still noteworthy and enjoyed today, even though he sadly passed in 1998.\n\nSinatra took a liking to music from a young age, and began singing soon after. His uncle gave him a ukulele for his fifteenth birthday, and he started playing at family gatherings. During his time at Demarest High School in Demarest, New Jersey, he arranged bands for school dances.\n\nAs a teenager in the 1930s, Sinatra began singing professionally, despite not being able to read music. When he was 20, his mom persuaded him to join a local singing group. The group became a success after winning a talent show hosted by Edward Bowes. Their prize was a six-month contract to perform on stage and on the radio across the U.S.\n\nSinatra released his solo debut in March 1946, titled The Voice of Frank Sinatra. He went on to release sixty-one more albums, some of which were live renditions of his hits.\n\nOver the span of his career, Sinatra captured the hearts of millions. His jazz-inspired sound has made a mark on the world that no new artist can erase."

LyricsI'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain\nI've got some habits even I can't explain\nCould start for the corner, turn up in Spain\nBut why try to change me now?\n\nI sit and daydream, I've got daydreams galore\nCigarette ashes, there they go on the floor\nI'll go away weekends, leave my keys in the door\nBut why try to change me now?\n\nWhy can't I be more conventional?\nPeople talk, people stare, so I try\nBut that's not for me, 'cause I can't see\nMy kind of crazy world go passing me by\n\nSo, let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown\nYou know I'll love you till the moon's upside down\nDon't you remember I was always your clown?\nWhy try to change me now?Embed"

Should I phone once more?\nNo, it's best that I stick to my tune\n[Verse 3]\nI get along without you very well, of course, I do\nExcept perhaps in Spring\nBut I should never think of Spring\nFor that would surely break my heart in twoEmbed"

   "lyrics": "Soliloquy LyricsI wonder what he'll think of me\nI guess he'll call me the \"old man\"\nI guess he'll think I can lick\nEv'ry other feller's father\nWell, I can!\nI bet that he'll turn out to be\nThe spittin' image of his dad\nBut he'll have more common sense\nThan his puddin-headed father ever had\nI'll teach him to wrassle\nAnd dive through a wave\nWhen we go in the mornin's for our swim\nHis mother can teach him\nThe way to behave\nBut she won't make a sissy out o' him\nNot him! Not my boy! Not Bill!\nBill. I will see that he is named after me, I will\nMy boy, Bill! He'll be tall\nAnd tough as a tree, will Bill!\nLike a tree he'll grow\nWith his head held high\nAnd his feet planted firm on the ground\nAnd you won't see nobody dare to try\nTo boss or toss him around!\nNo pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully'll toss him around\nI don't give a damn what he does\nAs long as he does what he likes!\nHe can sit on his tail\nOr work on a rail\nWith a hammer, hammering spikes!\nHe can ferry a boat on a river\nOr peddle a pack on his back\nOr work up and down\nThe streets of a town\nWith a whip and a horse and a hack\nHe can haul a scow along a canal\nRun a cow around a corral\nOr maybe bark for a carousel\nOf course it takes talent to do that well\nHe might be a champ of theheavyweights\nOr a feller that sells you glue\nOr President of the United States\nThat'd be all right, too\nHis mother would like that\nBut he wouldn't be President unless he wanted to be\nNot Bill!\nMy boy, Bill! He'll be tall\nAnd as tough as a tree, will Bill\nLike a tree he'll grow\nWith his head held high\nAnd his feet planted firm on the ground\nAnd you won't see nobody dare to try\nTo boss or toss him around!\nNo fat-bottomed, flabby-faced, pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bastard'll boss\nHim around\nAnd I'll be damned if he'll marry the boss' daughter\nA skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water\nWho'll give him a peck\nAnd call it a kiss\nAnd look in his eyes through a lorgnet\nSay, why am I talkin' on like this?\nMy kid ain't even been born, yet!\nI can see him when he's seventeen or so\nAnd startin' to go with a girl\nI can give him lots of pointers, very sound\nOn the way to get 'round any girl\nI can tell him ...\nWait a minute!\nCould it be?\nWhat the hell!\nWhat if he is a girl?\nWhat would I do with her?\nWhat could I do for her?\nA bum with no money!\nYou can have fun with a son\nBut you got to be a father to a girl\nShe mighn't be so bad at that\nA kid with ribbons in her hair!\nA kind o' neat and petite\nLittle tin-type of her mother!\nWhat a pair!\nI can just hear myself bragging about her!\nMy little girl\nPink and white\nAs peaches and cream is she\nMy little girl\nIs half again as bright\nAs girls are meant to be!\nDozens of boys pursue her\nMany a likely lad does what he can to woo her\nFrom her faithful dad\nShe has a few\nPink and white young fellers of two and three\nBut my little girl\nGets hungry ev'ry night and she come home to me!\nMy little girl, my little girl!\nI got to get ready before she comes!\nI got to make certain that she\nWon't be dragged up in slums\nWith a lot o' bums like me\nShe's got to be sheltered\nAnd be dressed in the best money can buy!\nI never knew how to get money\nBut, I'll try, by God! I'll try!\nI'll go out and make it or steal it\nOr take it or die!Embed"

Why doesn't my heart go dancing?\nSpring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?\nNo desire, no ambition leads me\nMaybe it's because nobody needs me?\nSpring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?\nStars appear! Why doesn't the night invite me?\nMaybe it's because nobody loves me\nSpring is here, I hear!Embed"

Von Englein bewacht\nDie zeigen in Traum, dir Christkindlein's baum\nSchlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in Traum's Paradies\nSchlaf' num selig und suss, schau' in Traum's Paradies\n\n(without poetic embellishments, this is the direct translationof Brahms)\n\nGood evening, good night, covered with roses\nWith tiny fingernails hidden, slipping under the blankets\nTomorrow morning, if God wills, you will wake again\nTomorrow morning, if God wills, you will wake again\n\nGod evening, good night, watched over by tiny angels\nWho show the little Christ Child's tree in dreams\nSleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise\nSleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradiseEmbed"

   "lyrics": "What Time Does The Next Miracle Leave? LyricsMy name is Francis Albert (Francis Albert Sinatra)\nAnd I sing love songs mostly after dark, mostly in saloons\nI've had some very good years\nI haven't missed a whole lot in those firecracker years\nAnd I don't want to miss a thing when the future appears\n\nI like to sit outside on a summer night with a drink in my hand\nAnd a little moonlit music on the stereo\nAnd look at the stars\nThen I get an urge to travel through that fabulous sky\nIf they can do it in the movies, why can't I?\n(\"Seats are now available on the Satellite Special leaving for Mercury, Venus, Pluto, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune.\")\nWhat time does the next miracle leave?\nI want to be on board\nSave me a seat by the window where I can see\nAll those marvelous things to be seen out there\n(Will the trees be green out there, or bare?)\nWhat time does the next miracle leave?\nLet's get this show on the road\nAnd when the satellite tours begin\nCount me in, count me in , count me in\nCount me in, count me in , count me in\n\n(\"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\")\nWhen I arrive at Venus, it will surely be spring\nAnd the girl I have waited for, will be waiting for me\nAnd she'll dance with me all the afternoon\nComfort me when the darkness falls\nAnd she'll still be there in the morning when I need her the most\nMaybe when I get to Venus, I will never be lonely again\n\n(\"The Satellite Special leaving for Jupiter, Saturn\")\n(Jupiter, Saturn)\nJupiter makes with the rain, Saturn makes with the crops\nA nicer trade was never made, and hopefully never stops\nIf Saturn's fields are dry, Jupiter won't stay fat\nSo Jupiter leaves his faucets on and that is that\n\n(\"Next stop, Pluto -- where the devil dwells, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\")\n\nPluto is a rotten place, an evil misbegotten place\nIt's Hades (It's Hades)\nFilled with graduates of the pen, a sordid flock of criminal men\nAnd ladies (Ladies?) (Ladies, ladies, ladies)\nIt's pure hell when your journey ends there\nBut you can bet your ass I'll meet a lot of friends there\n(We did it our way)\n(\"Next stop, Mercury, Mercury, the messenger, Mercury the messenger\")\n\nMercury will lead us out to Neptune and his deep blue sea\n(And then) And then to Uranus (Uranus)\nUranus is heaven\n(Heaven, heaven)\n(How will you know, Francis, if it's really heaven?)\nHow will I know?\nI will know\nIf they meet me at the station with a cheese and tomato pizza\nWell done (well done), and a little red wine\n\n(\"The Satellite Special now leaving non-stop for earth, non-stop for earth\")\n\n(We'll be on board when the next miracle leaves\nIt's time we were gettin' on home)\n\nPlease let me off at the desert, where I can see\nAll those wonderful things to be seen down there\n(Will the trees be green down there, or bare?)Embed"

I love you\nWrite to the Browns just as soon as you're able\nThey came around to call, and I burned a hole in the dining room table\nAnd let me see, I guess that's all\nNothing else for me to say, and so I'll close but by the way\nEverybody's thinking of you, P. S. I love you\nI do my best to obey all your wishes, I put a sign up \"Think\"\nBut I gotta buy us a new set of dishes, or wash the ones that are piled in the sink\nNothing else to tell you dear, except each day seems like a year\nEvery night I'm dreaming of you, P.

Oh I don't know, don't know;\nWind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes\nStories of love belong to you and to me\n\nOh, Dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful\nThings that I see when you're with me, Oh my Dindi\nOh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is\nSinging Dindi, Happy Dindi, When you're with me\n\nI love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;\nI'd let you go away, if you take me with you\n\nDon't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that\nCan't find the sea, that would be me without you, my Dindi\nCan't find the sea that would be me without you Dindi\nLike a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my DindiEmbed"

Begin the Beguine was written in 1935, and it's still very popular\n\nWhen they begin the beguine, it brings back the sound of music so tender\nIt brings back a night of tropical splendor, it brings back a memory ever green\nI'm with you once more under the stars, and down by the shore an orchestra's playing\nEven the palms seem to be swaying, when they begin the beguine\nTo live it again is past all endeavor, except when that tune clutches my heart\nAnd there we are, swearing to love forever, and promising never, never to part\nWhat moments divine, what rapture serene\nTill clouds come along to disperse the joys we had tasted\nAnd now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted\nI know but too well what they mean\nSo don't let them begin the beguine, let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;\nLet it sleep like the dead desire I only remember when they begin the beguine\nOh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play\nTill the stars that were there before return above you\nTill you whisper to me once more, Darling, I love you!\nAnd we suddenly know what heaven we're in, when they begin the beguine\nWhen they begin the beguineEmbed"

[dice rolls]\n\n[cello solo]\nIn years to come, I may forget if I lost or if I won\nBut I'll always remember how much fun it was\n(just a little five and four, just a little six and three)\n\nAnd when the music ends\nI'd like it to end this way\nI'll ask Chester to write me one more song\nI'll get Lefty to make me one more chart\nAnd I'll make one more record with the best musicians in the world\n\nAnd when that cat with the scythe\nComes tugging at my sleeve\nI'll be singing as I leave\n(Sinatra, Sinatra, Sinatra)Embed"

I think I'm gonna make it all the way\nBaby, get out of my wayEmbed"

LyricsWhere I live in the desert, it's so peaceful and warm\nAnd the cares of the world drift by, like clouds reflected in a quiet pool\nBut there always comes a time, when a man has to think of the future\n(War, war, war!) Has to think of his children, (war, war, war!)\nAnd the world they will live in (war, war, war, war!)\nI'm not sure if I can do anything to help them, but I can try, I can try\nTime to build us a fire, seven hundred feet high\nWe can fashion a fire (fire) that will reach the sky (reach the sky)\nWe can feed the flames with the unkind deeds we've done (with the fire)\n'Cause we've got to get ready, for World War None\n(What we want is to burn our sins in a sort of furnace,)\n(We'll be stoking the fire with the lies we know)\nAll our false suspicions we can burn them one by one\nThat will help us get ready for World War None\n(A little love is more effective than a rifle,)\n(A little faith will take you farther than it can)\n(The rule we follow is the one forever spoken)\n(They haven't got the truth on their lips)\nKeep on feeding the fire, till the fire is hot\nWith those un-neighborly feelings we deny we've got\nKeep on trying for peace, until that peace is won\nThen you're practically ready for World War None\n(A whispered word or touch is louder than a bugle)\n(A silent prayer is so much stronger than a sword,)\n(And the bombs that can't replace the stained glass window)\nFor which we should thank the good Lord, thank the good Lord)\n(Thank you, thank you, thank you)\nIf we cherish our fire (if we cherish our fire)\nIt could possibly be (it could possibly be)\nBright enough to be seen, (bright enough to be seen)\nFar across the sea (far across the sea)\nWhen those other countries (when those other countries)\nSee what we have done (what we've done)\nMaybe they'll help us get ready (get ready, get ready)\nFor World War None\n(World War None!)Embed"

Went the strings of my heart\n\nYour eyes made skies blue again\nWhat else could I do again\nKeep repeating through again\n\"I love you, love you\"\n\nI still recall the thrill, guess I always will\nI hope 'twill never depart\nAll nature seemed to be in perfect harmony\nZing! Went the strings of my heart\nYour eyes made skies blue again\nWhat else could I do again\nKeep repeating through again\n\"I love you, love you\"\n\nI still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will\nI hope 'twill never depart\nAll nature seemed to be in perfect harmony\nZing!

Could you care? (Now wait a minute!)\nFor a lovely cottage...

Wouldn't have no other kind but silk\n(Has it really got a team of snow-white horses?)\nOne's like snow, the others more like milk (so you can tell `em apart)\nAll the world would fly in a flurry\nWhen I take you out in the surrey\nWhen I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top\n\nWhen we hit that road hell for leather\nCats and dogs all dance in the heather\nBirds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop\n\nThe wind will whistle as we rattle along, the cows will moo in the clover\nThe river will ripple out a whispered song, and whisper it over and over\n\nDon't you wish you'd go on forever\nDon't wish you'd go on forever\nDon't you wish you'd go on forever and would never stop\nIn that shiny little surrey with fringe on the top?Embed"

Let's go on with the show\n\n(There's no business like show business like no business I know)\nYou get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn\nTop of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on\n\n(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)\nYesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are\nNext day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!Embed"

Where's my chapeau?\nBye bye Paree, I'm off to Napoli\n\n[musical interlude]\n\nThere's no Marie, she flew off to Napoli\nSay bon voyage, I got to go\nWhere's my corsage?

Yes, with his sweetheart, his so discreet heart\n(Oh Frank, he had me doing things that I shouldn't do.)\nThat cad, ain't no denying, so sense in trying\n(Let me tell you, it is just as bad. My education's been like some book.)\nBet you had an encyclopedia\n(Yet now I know the score at last.)\nSo I'm happy for you\n(I'm an gal with a past that left my head hot and perched in a sling.)\nYou mean you got yourself in hock?\n(Yes, it's understood that brother gypped me but good,)\n(A little learning) can be a dangerous thing\nYeah girl that's the kind of stuff you gotta watch out for\n(Oh makes me so nervous.)\nThat's right, it shakes you up...Embed"

   "lyrics": "Goin\u2019 Home LyricsSpoken:\nWherever we may be along about this time of year, our hearts become sentimental pilgrims and head for home. Because home is where we all discover that Christmas is one time of the year when we don't have to be wealthy to be rich. Some of us remember Christmas as the time when Dad gave us our first gold watch. Others remember it as the time when a charity organization delivered a Christmas basket to the doorstep before dawn, so the neighbors wouldn't see and Mother wouldn't be embarrassed. But whether the hearth that cheered your family was a fireplace of marble or a kitchen stove of cast iron, you'll remember that your home was the richest place on earth, warmed by the richest spirit on earth, the spirit of Christmas. And that's why I've chosen this next song to sing as a Christmas song. It's not a carol, it's just a beautiful pathway of friendly and understanding music up which our hearts may travel as they make their Yuletide pilgrimage goin' home\n\nGoin' home, goin' home\nI'm a'goin' home\nQuiet-like, some still day\nI'm a'goin' home\n\nIt's not far, just close by\nThrough an open door\nWork all done, care laid by\nGoin'ta fear no more\n\nMother's there, 'spectin' me\nFather's waitin', too\nLots of folks gathered there\nAll the friends I knew\nSpoken:\nOne of the most precious gifts we have throughout the year is one we often forget, the precious gift of freedom. Freedom to work, to play, to worship as we please. Freedom to decided how we'll handle our own future, 'cause we can make our future and that of our families a secure one though saving. We can buy Savings Bonds to take care of that new home or an education for our kids. No one says we hafta buy 'em, we wanna buy 'em, 'cause they're not only an investment in our own future, they're an investment in the finest country in the world. So let me urge you sincerely, as we look toward a new year, to plan for making it a secure year, for the regular purchase of US Savings Bonds. So long, everybody, and Merry ChristmasEmbed"

Wait till you get further down.)\nI had my boots on and I had them laced up tight\n(You talk like that in your era?)\nWrote a book, Pearl, but then I made a mistake\n(Most men do.)\nUh huh, I should have known from the start\n(Most men don't.)\nAha, let me tell you what happened last night\n(This is not this day's material?)\nIt's bad, 'cause it started with a gal\n(Always does.)\nAnd her name, it was Sal\n(Sal, corny.)\nOh she was cute. She was as fine as a bird on the wing\n(Yeah, you always could think up,)\n(But you are much too bright to fall in love the first night.)\nBut uh, a little learnin' is a dangerous thing\n(I told you that on the other side of the record.)\nAnd then we danced for a time or two, till she said she was blue\n(Uh, huh, there it is.)\nAnd right away, I was doing the thing...\n(Just rushing through life.)\n'Cause I was hip to the fact that I could always jump back\n(Do a thing.)\nBut a little learnin' is a dangerous thing\n(Yes it is.)\nShe made with sweet talk\n(Uh hmmm.)\nThat so hard-to-beat talk\n(Know what, Frank?)\nWhat's that?\n(I know she even called you darling, lover man!)\nYou've been eavesdropping\n(Yes, I have.)\nThat really sent me, coincidentally\nI should have known enough then to scram\n(No man is ever that clever -- that rhymes!)\nNow I guess you know it all, least that's all I recall\n(That's all you'll ever recall.)\nExcept the part about the man with a ring\n(Oh you're going again.)\nIn case it's news to you, the smartest I said I'd do\n(Oh you down.)\n:A little learning is a dangerous, is a dangerous thing\n(Oh, pure treachery, treachery!)\nStop, stop!Embed"

And do just as you should?\nWon't you turn that new leaf over, so your baby can be your slave?\nOh, why can't you behave?\nThere's a farm I know near my old home town\nWhere we two can go and try settling down\nThere I'll care for you forever, 'cause you're all in the world I crave\nBut baby, why can't you behave?\nI said I'll care for you forever, 'cause you're all in the world I crave\nBut why, why can't you behave?\nBaby, I'm all confusedEmbed"
