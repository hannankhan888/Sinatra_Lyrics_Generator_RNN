of ice but a little simple magic that i heard about somewhere changed the weather all around just within a trice i bought you violets for your furs and it was spring for a while remember i bought you violets for your furs and there was april in that december the snow drifted down on the flowers and it melted where it lay the snow looked like dew on the blossoms as on a summer day i bought you violets for your furs and there was blue in the wintry sky then you pinned the violets to your furs and gave a lift to the crowds passing by you smiled at me so sweetly since then one thought occurs that we fell in love completely the day that i bought you violets for your fursonce i laughed when i heard you say that id be playing solitaire uneasy in my easy chair it never entered my mind once you told me i was mistaken that id awaken with the sun and order orange juice for one it never entered my mind you had what i lack myself now i even have to scratch my back myself once you warned me that if you scorned me id say a lonely prayer again and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again it never entered my mindthe sleepless nights the daily fights the quick toboggan when you reach the heights i miss the kisses and i miss the bites i wish i were in love again the broken dates the endless waits the lovely loving and the hateful hates the conversation with the flying plates i wish i were in love again no more pain no more strain now im sane but i would rather be punch dr the pulled out fur of cat and cur the fine mismating of a him and her ive learned my lesson but i wish i were in love again the furtive sigh the blackened eye the words i love you til the day i die the self deception that believes the lie i wish i were in love again when love congeals it soon reveals the faint aroma of performing seals the doublecrossing of a pair of heels i wish i were in love again no no more care no no despair now im all there now but id rather be punch dr believe me sir i much prefer the classic battle of a him and her i dont like quiet and i wish i were in love again in love again in love againeast of the sun and west of the moon well build a dream house so

joke i walk in a room a party or ball come sit over here somebody will call a drink for msieur a drink for us all but how many times i stop and recall ah the apple trees blossoms in the breeze that we walked among lying in the hay games we used to play while the rounds were sung only yesterday when the world was young wherever i go they mention my name and that in itself is some sort of fame come by for a drink were having a game wherever i go im glad that i came the talk is quite gay the company fine theres laughter and lights and glamour and wine and beautiful girls and some of them mine but often my eyes see a diffrent shine ah the apple trees sunlit memories where the hammock swung on our backs wed lie looking at the sky till the stars were strung only last july when the world was young ah the apple trees blossoms in the breeze that we walked among lying in the hay games we used to play while the rounds were sung only yesterday when the world was young while sitting around we often recall the laugh of the year the night of them all the blonde who was so attractive that year some opening night that made us all cheer remember that time we all got so tight and jacques and antoine got into a fight the gendarmes who came passed out like a light i laugh with the rest its all very brightyou vowed your love from here to eternity a love so true it never would die you gave your lips gave them so willingly how could i know your kiss meant goodbye now im alone with only a memory my empty arms will never know why though you are gone this love that you left with me will live from here to eternity now im alone with only a memory my empty arms will never know why though you are gone this love that you left with me this endless desire will live from here to eternitya cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces an airline ticket to romantic places and still my heart has wings these foolish things remind me of you a tinkling piano in the next apartment those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant a fairgrounds painted swings these foolish things remind me of you you came you saw you conquered me when you did that to me i knew somehow this had to be the winds of march that make my heart a dancer a telephone that rings but whos to answer oh how the ghost of you clings these foolish things remind me of you the smile of turner and the scent of roses the waiters whistling as the last bar closes the song that crosby sings these foolish things remind me of youi laughed at sweethearts i met at schools all indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools a house in iceland was my hearts domain i saw your eyes now castles rise in spain i took one look at you thats all i meant to do and then my heart stood still my feet could step and walk my lips could move and talk and yet my heart stood still though not a single word was spoken i could tell you knew that unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew i never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when my heart stood still through all my school days i hated boys those april fool days brought me loveless joys i read my plato love i thought a sin but since your kiss im reading missus glynthe song a robin sings through years of endless springs the murmur of a brook at eventide that ripples by a nook where two lovers hide a great symphonic theme thats stella by starlight and not a dream my heart

painful steps and slow look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing o rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing for lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old when with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold when the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king and the whole world send back the song which now the angels singthe

go to hoboken one more time i wanna run down that street where that thin italian kid ran then slow down at the school where those nice old ladies tried to teach me unaware that i knew much more than they did and stop at the poolroom for a beer and sadly say to myself i dont know anybody here one thing id like to do before the music ends is to thank some wonderful lifelong friends ive never met but have known so well from one frank to another thank you for your dream your dream is now my own and thank you ludwig van for the flights of fancy you sent me on thank mrs verdi for joe and a

and the tears shed might claim you for the last time we have tasted loves sweet tears by the fires glow if our hearts are strong therell be no long goodbyes when its time to go but the strongest torch is sometimes broken as the deepest vows arent always spoken and the greatest wounds we hide inside ourselves where they never show dream away child let your dreams run wild or a lifetime of worries might claim you dream away child let your dreams run wild or the years and the tears shed might claim you when the winter weds the northern wind the child they bear is snow and the branches bow like worried bridesmaids but the trees will grow sun and earth in time will come together god will give us back our summer weather but the memries of that first sweet taste of love pass away so slow dream away child let your dreams run wild or a lifetime of worries might claim you dream away child let your dreams run wild or the years and the tears shed might claim you when theres no room left to live inside ourselves do we dream awaywhat makes the sunset what makes the moonrise what makes the tide remember to hide and why does it soon rise what makes a star fall where does it fall to why does its flight make us stop in the night and wish as we all do and what holds a cloud together what makes the sky so blue what makes the sunset what makes the moonrise is it my love for you instrumental and

colder suddenly youre a lot older and all because of the gal that got away no more her eager call the writings on the wall the dreams you dreamed have all gone astray the gal that won you has run off and undone you that great beginning has seen its final inning dont know what happened its all a crazy game no more that all time thrill for youve been though the mill and never a new love will be the same good riddance goodbye every trick of hers youre on to but fools will be fools and where she gone to the road gets rougher its lonelier and its tougher with hope you burn up tomorrow she may turn

gal that got awaylover when im near you and i hear you speak my name softly in my ear you breathe a flame lover its immoral but why quarrel with our bliss when two lips of coral want to kiss i say the devil is in you and to resists you i try but if you didnt continue i would die lover please be tender when youre tender fears depart lover i surrender to my heartno one ever tells you whats like to love and lose how it feels to waken and have breakfast with the blues how to go on living how to face another day no one ever tells you the way no one ever tells you how it feels to walk alone listening for those footsteps through the echo of your own suddenly it hits you all those dreams werent worth a dime cause no one ever tells you in time long before the icy winds of winter autumn tells the swallows time to fly why did she pretend til the bitter end til it broke my heart to say goodbye no one ever tells you that its just another fling no one ever warns you when your heart begins to sing someone tells you later all is fair in love and war but no one ever tells you before no one ever tells you that its just another fling no one ever warns you when your heart begins to sing someone tells you later all is fair in love and war but no one ever tells you before it never comes easy no one ever tells you beforeyoure nobody till somebody loves you youre nobody till

im reckless its true but what else can you do at the end of a love affair so i talk a little too much and i laugh a little too much and my voice is too loud when im out in a crowd so that people are apt to stare do they know do they care that its only that im lonely and low as can be and the smile on my face isnt really a smile at all so i smoke a little too much and i drink a little too much and the tunes i request are not always the best but the ones where the trumpets blare so i go at a maddening pace and i pretend that its taking her place but what else can you do at the end of a love affair so i smoke a little too much and i drink a little too much and the tunes i request are not always the best but the ones where the trumpets blare so i go at a maddening pace and i pretend that its taking her place but what else can you do at the end of a love affairone afternoon i came to hear you sing a soft song into my ear who would have thought quite by chance we might engage in a loving dance coming together coming apart lost in diversions dancing stars caught in the quiet off on our own coming together standing alone are you afraid im not afraid what about you what about me

end as for us you and me our eyes are open we can see both of us know where weve been why must we both go dancing again come join the dancing come join the waltz dont look too closely at my faults why

has meant heaven to you you have vowed your affection to each one in turn and have sworn to them all youd be true you have kissed neath the moon while the world seemed in tune then youve left her to hunt a new game does it ever occur to you later my boy that shes probly doing the same if you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue just imagine the girl you love best in the arms of some fellow whos stealing a kiss from the lips that you once fondly pressed but the world moves apace and the loves of today flit away with a smile and a tear so you can never tell whos kissing her now or just whom youll be kissing next year i wonder whos kissing her now i wonder whos teaching her how i wonder whos looking into her eyes breathing sighs telling lies i wonder whos buying the wine for lips that i used to call mine i wonder if she ever tells him of me i wonder whos kissing her nowspoken wherever we may be along about this time of year our hearts become sentimental pilgrims and head for home because home is where we all discover that christmas is one time of the year when we dont have to be wealthy to be rich some of us remember christmas as the time when dad gave us our first gold watch others remember it as the time when a charity organization delivered a christmas basket to the doorstep before dawn so the neighbors wouldnt see and mother wouldnt be embarrassed but whether the hearth that cheered your family was a fireplace of marble or a kitchen stove of cast iron youll remember that your home was the richest place on earth warmed by the richest spirit on earth the spirit of christmas and thats why ive chosen this next song to sing as a christmas song its not a carol its just a beautiful pathway of friendly and understanding music up which our hearts may travel as they make their yuletide pilgrimage goin home goin home goin home im agoin home quietlike some still day im agoin home its not far just close by through an open door work all done care laid by gointa fear no more mothers there spectin me fathers waitin too lots of folks gathered there all the friends i knew spoken one of the most precious gifts we have throughout the year is one we often forget the precious gift of freedom freedom to work to play to worship as we please freedom to decided how well handle our own future cause we can make our future and that of our families a secure one though saving we can buy savings bonds to take care of that new home or an education for our kids no one says we hafta buy em we wanna buy em cause theyre not only an investment in our own future theyre an investment in the finest country in the world so let me urge you sincerely as we look toward a new year to plan for making it a secure year for the regular purchase of us savings bonds so long everybody and merry christmasjust for now lets call it romance just for now lets take a chance we both know it would seem to be the real thing that makes the bells ring but dare we dream just for now lets not be clever just for now lets just be gay and come what may that certain day will find us somehow it will be always instead of just for now just for now lets not be clever just for now lets just be gay and come what may that certain day will find us somehow it will be always instead of just for nowit only happens when i dance with you that trip to heaven when the dance is through with noone else do the heavens seem quite so near why does it happen here only with you two cheeks together can be so sublime especially when those cheeks are yours and mine ive danced with hundreds of
